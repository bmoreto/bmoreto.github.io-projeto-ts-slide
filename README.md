# 🎞️ TypeScript Slide Project  
A simple, functional, and elegant slide/carousel component built during the **Origamid – TypeScript for Beginners** course.  
This project focuses on DOM manipulation, TypeScript class structure, clean code organization, and UI interaction using **TypeScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript ES Modules**.

---

## 🚀 About the Project  

This project was developed as part of my journey to understand TypeScript more deeply and apply it to real interface components.

The goal was to build a **fully functional slide/carousel** from scratch, using object-oriented programming with TypeScript.  
Through this project, I learned how to combine strong typing with DOM manipulation to create safe, scalable, and reusable UI components.

The slide navigation is handled by buttons dynamically generated by the component, allowing the user to switch between slides interactively.

## 🧠 What I Learned  

This project strengthened my understanding of:

- TypeScript classes and OOP structure  
- How `this` behaves in methods and event callbacks  
- Defining types for DOM elements (e.g., `Element`, `HTMLElement`)  
- Creating reusable components with constructors  
- Modularizing code using imports and exports  
- Organizing projects into `src` (TS) and `dist` (JS) folders  
- Ensuring safe DOM operations through type checking  
- Deploying static projects using GitHub Pages
